# Exoplanet_Senior_Research
My senior research project at NWU. Designed to take in data from Kepler satellite and determine if exoplanet is present.
Takes in multiple .fits files as input, converts flux data and repeatedly overlays them based on range of guess of planetary orbital time.
If periodic decrease in flux exists, a noticable decrease in flux will occur when data is overlayed with proper period.
Program then attempts to determine parameters of stellar system.
